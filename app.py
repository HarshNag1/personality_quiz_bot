Based on our conversation, I've gained some fascinating insights about you. Here's what I've learned:

You appear to be someone who is {traits[0]}. When it comes to making decisions, you {traits[1]}, which suggests you have a good balance between emotion and logic.

In terms of your approach to life, you're {traits[2]}, and when facing challenges, you tend to be {traits[3]}. In conversations, you're typically {traits[4]}.

These traits combine to make you uniquely you, {name}! Would you like to:
1. Ask questions about your personality type
2. Start a new assessment
3. Learn more about how to leverage your strengths

Just type 1, 2, or 3 to continue our conversation!"""
